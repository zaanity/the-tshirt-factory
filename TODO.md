# TODO: Deployment on Render.com

## Tasks

- [ ] Ensure backend build script (`npm run build`) and start script (`npm start`) work correctly on Render
- [ ] Confirm CORS configuration in backend app.ts includes Render frontend URL
- [ ] Update Frontend API_URL in `src/utils/api.ts` to point to deployed backend URL (use environment variables or Render secrets)
- [ ] Build frontend using `npm run build` and serve static files or deploy frontend separately on Render
- [ ] Check for any hardcoded localhost URLs in frontend or backend and replace with environment variables or dynamic URLs
- [ ] Test full app functionality on Render deployment (API calls, auth, product management, etc.)
- [ ] Add Render service files if needed (e.g., render.yaml) for deployment configuration
- [ ] Review logs and error handling for production readiness
- [ ] Optimize build and dependencies for production

Please confirm if you want me to proceed with a detailed audit and fixes for deployment on Render.com or if you have specific areas you want me to focus on.
